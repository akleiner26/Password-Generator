# Password-Generator
A Random Password Generator

## Description

As society moves into the the 21st century, internet security has become more and more important to the average user. Due to federal, private, and commercial databasing, user information is now spread wide across countless sources. As identity theft and fraud become more prevelant in the tech world, it has become significantly more important for users to have strong passwords that can protect them from such cyber risks.

This password generating page stands to offer the user a randomized password, set by the users preset needs. By asking the user how long they would like their password, and which characters they would like to include, the possibilities of offering a strong, protected password become endless. 

With the strong password provided, a user can ensure that their private information stored in various website's databases are protected from those who stand to take advantage of its accessibility. By using this java script code, which randomly selects characters from multiple arrays to meet the requirements of the user, this protection becomes significantly more attainable, with little effort from the user.
